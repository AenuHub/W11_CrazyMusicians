This project is aiming to showcase the usage of Web API in ASP.NET Core.

### Project Overview

Create an ASP.NET Core Web API using the funny and entertaining data table provided. The API supports basic CRUD 
(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with the following requirements:

- Implement at least **2 GET**, **1 POST**, **1 PATCH**, **1 PUT**, and **1 DELETE** endpoints.
- Use routing operations as described in the example in **Weekly Technical Content 5**. Routes can be diversified 
and customized.
- Perform necessary **Validation** operations.
- Utilize at least one `[FromQuery]` structure (e.g., for search functionality).
- Follow the general routing style.
